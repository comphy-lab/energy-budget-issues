Repository for the Basilisk C course at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (March 10-13, 2025).

## Course Description

This intensive course provides a comprehensive introduction to high-fidelity simulations using Basilisk C, a powerful computational framework for fluid dynamics. Participants will learn to implement and solve complex fluid mechanics problems with an emphasis on multiphase flows, interface dynamics, and non-Newtonian rheology.

### What You'll Learn

- **Think before you compute!** Understanding the physics before implementation
- **Writing the first code in Basilisk C** Getting comfortable with the framework
- **Solving conservation equations** Numerical approaches to fluid dynamics
- **Interface tracking methods** Capturing multiphase phenomena accurately
- **Non-Newtonian flows** Modeling complex rheological behaviors

### Course Details

- **Dates**: March 10-13, 2025
- **Location**: Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain
- **Duration**: 4 days, full-time
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Basic knowledge of fluid mechanics
  - Experience with programming (any language, C preferred)
  - Understanding of partial differential equations
  - Laptop with ability to compile C code

## Repository Structure

```
├-- basilisk/src/: Core Basilisk CFD library (reference only)
├── postProcess/: Project-specific post-processing tools
├── src-local/: Custom header files extending Basilisk functionality
├── testCases/: Test cases with their own Makefile
```

## Installation

Basilisk requires a C99-compliant compiler and GNU make. Installation can be done in two ways:

### Global Installation

#### Using darcs (recommended)
```bash
sudo apt install darcs make gawk
darcs clone http://basilisk.fr/basilisk
cd basilisk/src

# For Linux/Ubuntu users (preferred mode of operation)
ln -s config.gcc config

# For Mac users
# ln -s config.osx config

make
```

#### Using a tarball
```bash
wget http://basilisk.fr/basilisk/basilisk.tar.gz
tar xzf basilisk.tar.gz
cd basilisk/src

# For Linux/Ubuntu users (preferred mode of operation)
ln -s config.gcc config

# For Mac users
# ln -s config.osx config

make
```

#### Add to your shell configuration (.bashrc or .zshrc)
```bash
echo "export BASILISK=$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$BASILISK' >> ~/.bashrc
```
Or for zsh users:
```bash
echo "export BASILISK=$PWD" >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$BASILISK' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Repository Level Installation

For project-specific installations, you can use the provided `reset_install_requirements.sh` script which:
- Installs Basilisk within your project directory
- Sets up environment variables locally (in `.project_config`)
- Automatically detects your OS (MacOS or Linux) and uses appropriate configuration
- Verifies the installation

#### Basic usage:
```bash
# Run the script to install or use existing installation
./reset_install_requirements.sh

# For a fresh installation (removes existing one if present)
./reset_install_requirements.sh --hard

# Load the environment settings for your current shell session
source .project_config
```

The script will create a `.project_config` file in your project root with the necessary environment variables. This approach avoids modifying your global shell configuration and keeps the Basilisk installation contained within your project.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Compatibility

Testing on WSL is currently incomplete. In principle, the Linux installation instructions should work for WSL environments. If you encounter any issues while installing or running Basilisk on WSL, please report them by [opening a bug report](https://github.com/comphy-lab/Basilisk-101/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=bug,wsl).

### Complete Installation Instructions

For more detailed installation instructions, including configuration for different systems, setting up environment variables, installing additional dependencies, and optional libraries, please refer to the official installation guide at [http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL](http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL).

### Running the codes

To use the make file do:
```bash
CFLAGS=-DDISPLAY=-1 make NAME-of-File.tst
```
