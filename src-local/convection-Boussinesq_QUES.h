# Boussinesq Approximation for Thermal Convection

This module implements the Boussinesq approximation for thermal convection
in the classic Rayleigh-Benard configuration. Temperature is treated as a 
passive tracer that advects with the flow and diffuses, while also generating
buoyancy forces according to the Boussinesq approximation.

The momentum equation with the Boussinesq approximation becomes:
$$
\partial_t \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = 
-\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{g} \beta (T - T_0)
$$

where $\beta$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $T_0$ is the reference temperature,
and $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector (pointing downward).

The temperature evolves according to the advection-diffusion equation:
$$
\partial_t T + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla T = \kappa \nabla^2 T
$$

where $\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity.
