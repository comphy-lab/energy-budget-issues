/**
 ## 1D Transient Heat Conduction Solver (Using Basilisk diffusion.h)
 
 This program solves the transient heat conduction equation in one dimension:
 
 $$
 \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}
 $$
 
 - Subject to no-flux boundary conditions on both ends of the domain.
 - Initial condition is a "Dirac delta" approximated by a thin rectangle
 centered at $x=0$ with total integral = 1.
 
 The exact self-similar analytical solution is:
 
 $$
 T(x,t) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi t}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}
 $$
 
This version uses the diffusion.h module from Basilisk to handle the diffusion equation implicitly.
