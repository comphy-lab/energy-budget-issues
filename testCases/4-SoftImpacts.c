 * # Soft Impact Dynamics with Viscoelastic Fluids
 *
 * This simulation explores the fascinating physics of soft impact phenomena 
 * using viscoelastic fluids. Applications include droplet impact dynamics, 
 * inkjet printing, coating processes, and soft material interactions.
 *
 * ## Learning Objectives
 *
 * By working with this simulation, you will:
 * 1. Understand how viscoelasticity affects impact dynamics
 * 2. Learn to implement axisymmetric simulations in Basilisk
 * 3. Practice working with dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics
 * 4. Explore adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for interface tracking
 * 5. Analyze stability considerations in complex multiphase flows
 *
 * ## Hands-on Exercises (suggested)
 *
 * - Modify the Weber number to observe surface tension effects
 * - Change the Weissenberg number to see how elasticity affects jet formation
 * - Experiment with different initial conditions
 * - Compare scalar vs. tensor viscoelastic models

 * ## Viscoelastic Model Implementation
 * 
 * Viscoelastic fluids (like polymer solutions) show both viscous and elastic behaviors:
 * - Viscous: Resist flow like honey (dissipates energy)
 * - Elastic: Spring-like memory effects (stores energy)
 *
 * We use the log-conformation approach for numerical stability when simulating viscoelastic fluids.
 * This method transforms the conformation tensor logarithmically to preserve positive-definiteness
 * during the numerical solution, avoiding the "high Weissenberg number problem" that plagues
 * traditional approaches.

 * - **rho1, rho2**: Density ratio between liquid and gas (1:0.001)
 * - **mu1, mu2**: Viscosity ratio controlled by Ohnesorge numbers
 * - **lambda1, lambda2**: Relaxation times (polymer has memory, gas does not)
 * - **G1, G2**: Elastic moduli (polymer is elastic, gas is not)
 * - **f.sigma**: Surface tension coefficient (normalized to 1.0)
 * 
 * NOTE: For viscoelastic fluids, the total stress tensor has three contributions:
 * σ = -pI + μs(∇u + ∇u^T) + G(A-I)
 * where:
 * - p is pressure
 * - μs is solvent viscosity
 * - G is elastic modulus
 * - A is the conformation tensor (represents polymer stretching)

  // Viscosity from Ohnesorge numbers
